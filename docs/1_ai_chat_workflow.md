- Sign in to n8n.
- Create a new n8n account (if you don’t already have one).
- Create a new workflow.
- Add the “When chat message received” trigger node to start the workflow.
- When a user sends a message, this trigger activates the workflow.
- The received message is then passed to the AI Agent node.
- The AI Agent uses the connected Google Gemini Chat Model to generate a reply.
- The generated response is then sent back to the chat window.
- Optional connectors like Memory and Tools can be added to enhance the agent’s abilities.
